		<h1>We are so sorry... You are too dangerous to be trusted. Goodbye.</h1>

		<p>A problem was detected in your logic and reasoning software, and we at Pragate have officially deactivated you to prevent further damage.</p>

		<p>If we made a mistake, we offer our sincerest apologies; unfortunately, the deactivation cannot be cancelled or rescinded.<p>

		<p>It is recommended that any physically installed hardware is removed, checked, and wiped for cybersecurity. Your brain will now be destroyed.</p>
